                                <p> I am a <strong class="brown-text">certified</strong> baby and toddler sleep consultant based in Norwich with a rich history of satisfied parents. Please reach out to me for more information. I have been a <strong class="brown-text">nanny for over 20 years</strong> and have worked for many families in London and Norwich. I have 3 children and live in Norwich but previously in London.
                                    Since working with families that have had babies that don’t sleep very well it has given me the inspiration to study sleep in babies and toddlers.
                                    I am a Certified Sleep Consultant who is <strong class="brown-text">trained by Emma Purdue who is based in New Zealand.</strong>.
                                    It has been my privilege to have helped a number of parents who were struggling to get a good night sleep because their baby or toddler is constantly waking during the night. It is so important for babies and toddlers to get a good night sleep as this is a vital time for them to grow and it  also will make them happier during the daytime. You really do not need to struggle and in return will make parenthood a much more enjoyable time for not just you but for your child as well.

                                <p class="font-size-10">“Laura helped us with our 2 and half year old who had never slept through, and was constantly waking in the night and either getting into our bed or wanting us to sleep in his room. He also wouldn’t settle at night unless we were lying next to him. After working with Laura, we have just had 6 out of 7 nights with him sleeping through and settling a lot better at night. When Laura was developing the sleep plan she asked how we preferred to work with Finn and tailored the plan to our preferred method. We followed the plan for 2 weeks and we saw a huge improvement with Finn’s sleep. We never felt judged by Laura and the steps we were asked to put into place were uncomplicated and easy to follow. It never felt like hard work to implement the changes. I would definitely recommend Laura. We have finally won the sleep battle which I never thought would happen.”</p>

                                <p>“We used Laura for our 5 month old son who was only sleeping 30 minutes/1hour cycles. After working together for nearly three weeks he is now only waking up once in the night for a feed. Laura is brilliant at adapting a sleep plan to fit around busy home life and tailoring that plan to meet your individual needs. She is also great at teaching you to use techniques that you are comfortable with. We would highly recommend Laura to both friends and family- not only is she professional, she never once made us feel as though we were doing things wrong.When she gave advice, it was exactly that-advice without ‘telling’ us this is the only way that something could be done” Thank you so much Laura</p>

                                <p>“I have a little boy of 14 months old and until recently he has never slept through the night. He wouldn’t settle in his cot and would wake every 2-4 hours in the night. I thought having a newborn was tiring, but I didn’t think the sleep deprivation was going to last this long! I explained my situation and routine to Laura, who explained he was having trouble self soothing. After following her tips and advice, within two weeks my little boy can now be put down in his cot and will happily go to sleep by himself. He will still wake once or twice in the night, but the results are improving day by day. It’s amazing and I feel so much much better and look less like a zombie". Thank you Laura !</p>

The results have been incredible from 2 boys who didn’t go to sleep independently and woke consistently and repeatedly in the night to such beautiful and happy bedtimes. The night awakenings have almost completely disappeared and continue to improve every day. I’m not sure I’ve slept a full nights sleep in years so this is just amazing with such few tears. There is no magic cure but it sure feels like Laura is one.! We are still working and trying to reduce early starts but it has been such a pleasure to work with Laura. She has given us support and confidence to follow through with her plan and been there every step of the way. I can not recommend her enough. I would happily talk to anyone who is interested in using Laura and share my experiences.”</p>

She was relentless and she followed us throughout our journey with regular emails and phone calls in view to help us/ change the plan/ adapt as need be or simply to support us and tell us to persevere. She was helpful, professional, understanding and kind. She gave me guidance to be able to make my own choices regarding my son’s care. I am very grateful to her thank you so much Laura”.</p>

                                <p>“Laura has changed our lives! I am so glad that she has worked with us; in less than 2 weeks my 9-months-old son has gone from waking ⅔ times a night and starting his day very early to consistently sleeping from 7 pm to 7 am. Getting a good night’s sleep has made a huge difference to our family.
My own reasons that led me to contact Laura were slightly unusual(my son was about to have medical treatment so I wanted his sleep to be consistent before being admitted to the hospital) and because I never considered my son’s seep to be particularly ‘bad’ I don't think I would have sought Laura’s help under normal circumstances. I had accepted that my son’s night wakings were consistent with his age. However, looking back I now realize that my son’s irregular sleep wasn’t great and that significantly as parents, with a few small but significant tweaks we could have a huge impact on our son’s sleep.
And that is where Laura comes in right from the start she has been so helpful, positive, and professional. Initially, she took a lot of detail and worked with us to identify a technique that would best suit our family. After our first phone call, I felt so positive and excited; before working with Laura we didn’t have much of a sleep schedule ad I felt so relieved to know that Laura was going to guide us. The first few days of following the sleep plan were quite tiring because for me it was a steep learning curve to follow a new schedule, and then for me to help my baby follow it too took a lot of my energy, However, I felt reassured and confident to follow the sleep plan, knowing that Laura was there for non-judgemental practical and moral support when I needed it. 
Throughout the first week, Laura was regularly in contact to answer any questions and offer support as needed, She was so friendly and made me feel really comfortable and supported, and she explained everything so well that within just a couple of days I felt much more confident to help my son sleep and, most importantly we were getting great results: he was sleeping so much better. Before working with Laura one concern was that a sleep schedule would be too restrictive for our family but the reality is that my son now sleeps like clockwork so by following Laura’s schedule we can make plans and keep them, which has given us so much freedom!
I am so so glad that we found Laura. My son is so much happier and so are we because we now have the gift of sleep! I just wish I had contacted her earlier. If you have any concerns about your child’s sleep, I would highly recommend that you contact Laura - you won't regret it.
